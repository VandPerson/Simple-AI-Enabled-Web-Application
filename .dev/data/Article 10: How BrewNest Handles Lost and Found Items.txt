If a customer leaves a personal item at a BrewNest location, they can call the store directly or email lost@brewnest.eu. Items are kept in a secure box on-site for 14 days before being donated or discarded. For wallets or IDs, staff attempt to contact the owner if details are available. BrewNest is not responsible for lost electronics or valuables left unattended.
